Hang him not Free him is a game very similar to hangman.
The user/player is asked to choose a category: movies, animal or places.
Depending on the chosen category, a clue is generated and blank spaces are provided. 
The user/player must guess the right word(s) before running out of the total number of attempts and/or before exceeding the allowed number of wrong guesses.
As and when the user/player makes a wrong gues, a part of the man gets hanged in the turtle window.
To win, the user/player must guess the name correctly and prevent the man from hanging.
If the maximum attempts or the maximum wrong attempts are reached, the man gets hanged and the user/player looses the game.
